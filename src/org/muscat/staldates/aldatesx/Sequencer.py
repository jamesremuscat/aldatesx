class Sequencer(Thread):
    '''
    A threaded sequencer that queues Events and executes them periodically. You should call start() once you've
    created your Sequencer: this isn't done for you. The queue is checked, and events executed, at an interval
    of around one second. This means that there will be a delay of around one second between two consecutive
    scheduled Events - there is no need to add a wait(1) between them.

    Once started, the Sequencer runs in a daemonized thread and will keep running until your program otherwise
    terminates.

    Events can be any Python function, but in this context are probably calls to methods on a Controller, or the
    special 'wait' event returned by a call to Sequencer.wait(secs), which does as it says on the tin.

    There should probably only be one Sequencer in a system, and it should probably reside on the controller side
    and not the user interface side. Breaching either of these conditions should be preceded by some Deep Thought
    about possible side effects.
